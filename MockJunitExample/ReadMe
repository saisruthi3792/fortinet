We can mock the database for unit testing the service layer. 
Unit testing means testing the behavior of the current method and not its dependencies.
In service layer, we invoke the Dao objects, which in turn interacts with the database. 
Therefore, when we want to unit test the service layer alone, 
we are actually doing the integration test. 
Hence, when we are testing some behavior that is dependent on another behavior, 
we can mock the dependent behavior. In our case, the dependent behavior is the Dao class. 
We can mock the behavior of the DAO class and test the functionality of the service class alone.
